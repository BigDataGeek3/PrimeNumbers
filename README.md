# PrimeNumbers
# This script is for VBA to be used in MS Excel
# Set iend as the stopping point
# The first two prime numbers 2 & 3 are given by default, the first for loop - i runs from 4 to iend
# The second for loop j divides i by each one of the existing prime numbers in the list, if i is not divisible by any of them i is added to the bottom of the list in Column A
# Output: in column A you will have a list of prime numbers starting from 2,3,5,7......last prime number before iend
